Create components for a Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) project.

When building the ROSCA system, it's important to break down the structure into logical and reusable components. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:

1. Overview of the Project
Start by explaining the key parts of a ROSCA:

A group of people contribute money into a pool regularly.
Each member takes turns receiving the total pooled amount.
Each of these functionalities can be broken down into smaller, manageable components within a React project.

2. Break Down the Components
Think of the UI and functionality in reusable parts. This approach will make the project easier to maintain and extend.
